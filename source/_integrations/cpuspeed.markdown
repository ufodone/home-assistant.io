The CPU Speed integration allows you to monitor the current CPU speed.

<div class='note warning'>

  You can't use this sensor in a container (only Home Assistant Core is supported) as it requires access to the physical CPU. Also, not all [ARM CPUs](https://github.com/workhorsy/py-cpuinfo/#cpu-support) are supported.
