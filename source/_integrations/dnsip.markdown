The DNS IP integration will expose an IP address, fetched via DNS resolution, as its value. It provides both IPv4 and IPv6 lookup as separate sensors depending on accessibility to resolvers.

1. When you enable the integration with the default value, it will query the [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com/) nameservers with the hostname `myip.opendns.com`, which will resolve to your external/public IP address.
2. If you specify a `hostname`, a regular DNS lookup will be performed, providing you the IP the hostname resolves to.
