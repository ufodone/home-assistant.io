The GitHub integration allows you to monitor your favorite [GitHub][github] repositories.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

When you set up this integration, you will first be guided to allow the integration to use the [GitHub API][github_api] on your behalf. If you do not yet have a [GitHub][github] account you will be prompted to create one during the configuration of the integration.

When you have authorized the integration, you select repositories you want to monitor, the list contains repositories you have created and [starred][github_starred] on GitHub with your account.

Most of the entities provided by this integration are disabled by default, you can enable these by going to the {% my entities title="entities panel" %}.

## Remove authorization

After you have removed the integration from {% my integrations title="Configuration -> Devices & Services" %}, you need to manually revoke OAuth app authorization.

1. Go to your [Authorized OAuth Apps][github_apps]
2. Find the "Home Assistant GitHub Integration" application
3. Click the 3 dots (`...`) to the right of the name
4. Select "Revoke"
